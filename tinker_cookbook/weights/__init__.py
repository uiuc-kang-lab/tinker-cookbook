"""Weight lifecycle utilities for Tinker training.

Provides functions for downloading, building, and publishing trained model
weights. The typical workflow is:

    download → build → publish

Each function takes local paths as input/output, making them composable
and independently testable.

Example::

    from tinker_cookbook import weights

    adapter_dir = weights.download(
        tinker_path="tinker://run-id/sampler_weights/final",
        output_dir="./adapter",
    )
    weights.build_hf_model(
        base_model="Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B",
        adapter_path=adapter_dir,
        output_path="./model",
    )
    weights.publish_to_hf_hub(model_path="./model", repo_id="user/my-finetuned-model")
"""
